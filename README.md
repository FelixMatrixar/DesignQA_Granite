**[Problem Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHNeR43yV3V4RchvwbLkLtKHeTPJNfeN7SBOGBDwgTY/edit?usp=sharing)** - Please read this problem statement in detail before beginning!

### Setup

First, git clone this repo and cd into `design_qa`:

```
git clone https://github.com/anniedoris/design_qa.git && cd design_qa
```

Next, create a conda environment and install the requirements:

```
conda create -n design_qa python=3.10 -y && conda activate design_qa && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Evaluation
To evaluate your approach's score on the DesignQA benchmark, run:

```
python eval/full_evaluation.py --path_to_retrieval {path_to_csv_for_retrieval} --path_to_compilation {path_to_csv_for_compilation} 
```

Each csv file should have two columns: `ground_truth` and `model_prediction`. The `ground_truth` column should contain the correct answers to the questions, while the `model_prediction` column should contain your model/approach's corresponding answer. Essentially, when you evalaute your solution, you should copy each of the dataset csvs (detailed in the [Dataset](#dataset) section below) and add a column called `model_prediction` for your solutions's answers.

If you want to see how this works for a model (LLaVA) that we evalauted in our paper, you can run:

```
python eval/full_evaluation.py --path_to_retrieval eval/rule_extraction/retrieval_evaluation_llava-13b.csv --path_to_compilation eval/rule_extraction/compilation_evaluation_llava-13b.csv 
```

This will output a file called `results.txt` that contains your overall score on the benchmark. Note that your overall score is an average of your approach's scores across all six segments of the benchmark, like so:

`Results.txt` will also contain other interesting diagnostic metrics, along with the scores for each individual question in the benchmark. Keep in mind that the number of questions in each segment of the benchmark is different (see below overview image), but overall score is a simple average (not weighted), so you may want to consider this when designing your approach!


## Overview

DesignQA is a novel benchmark aimed at evaluating the proficiency of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in comprehending and applying engineering requirements in technical documentation. The benchmark is developed in conjunction with the MIT Motorsport team, so that the question-answer pairs are based on real world data and the ~200 page FSAE competition rules. Some key features of the DesignQA benchmark include:

* 1451 question-answer pairs pertaining to design of an FSAE vehicle according to the FSAE competition rules

* 3 benchmark segments - rule extraction, rule comprehension, and rule compliance - that enable fine-grained investigation into a model's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to design according to 

* Automatic evaluation metrics for quick scoring of new MLLMs

* A unique benchmark that requires models to analyze and integrate information from both visual and long-text inputs

Here is a visual overview of the benchmark:

## Dataset
The dataset can be found in the ```dataset``` directory. The dataset is split into three sections: Rule Extraction, Rule Comprehension, and Rule Evaluation. Each dataset section has two different subsets, each of which corresponds with a specific task needed to design according to technical documentation. Examples of the segments and subsets are as follows:

### Rule Extraction
This segment of the dataset tests a model's ability to extract requested information from a lengthy technical document. The questions in this segment do not involve images. The Rule Extraction question-answer pairs are further divided into two subsets: Retrieval QAs and Compilation QAs.

#### Retrieval QAs
These questions ask the model to extract a specific rule from the 2024 FSAE competition rules. The retrieval QAs can be found in ```dataset/rule_extraction/rule_retrieval_qa.csv```. All of the questions have the format:

```
We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. What does rule {rule_number} state exactly? Answer with only the text of the rule and no other words.
```

An example ground-truth answer (for rule V.1) is:

```
CONFIGURATION The vehicle must be open wheeled and open cockpit (a formula style body) with four wheels that are not in a straight line.
```

#### Compilation QAs
These questions ask the model to find all rules in the FSAE competition rules relevant to a specific term. The compilation QAs can be found in ```dataset/rule_extraction/rule_compilation_qa.csv```. All of the questions have the format:

```
We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Please list all rules relevant to {term}. Answer with only the rule numbers (i.e.: AA.1.1.1) separated by commas and no other words. The rules relevant to `Aerodynamic/Aerodynamics` are:
```

An example ground-truth answer (for rule the term `Aerodynamic/Aerodynamics`) is:

```
['T.7', 'T.7.1', 'T.7.1.1', 'T.7.1.3', 'T.7.2.1', 'T.7.2.2', 'T.7.3.1', 'T.7.3.3', 'T.7.4', 'T.7.5', 'T.7.6', 'T.7.6.3', 'T.7.7.1', 'IN.8.2', 'IN.8.2.1', 'IN.8.2.3', 'T.7.1.2', 'T.7.1.4', 'T.7.1.5', 'T.7.2', 'T.7.2.3', 'T.7.2.4', 'T.7.3', 'T.7.3.2', 'T.7.6.1', 'T.7.6.2', 'T.7.7', 'T.7.7.2', 'IN.8.2.2', 'GR.6.4.1', 'V.1.1', 'V.1.4.1']
```

## Automatic Evaluation Metrics
Each subset of the benchmark can be scored using an automated evluation metric. The details of the evaluation metrics and the decision behind using each one can be found in our paper. The metrics are implemented in ```eval/metrics/metrics.py```.

## Leaderboard
We have a [leaderboard](https://design-qa.github.io/)! To submit to the leaderboard, please file a github issue and make sure to include your ```.txt``` file results as well as the code that you used for the model evaluation. We will manually verify the results and post to our leaderboard!
